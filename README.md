# Frontend-Task

## This task is being built with React Frontend Library

The aim of this task is to efficiently pivot Github data in a way that users are in the center of it.

Focusing on Angular repo https://github.com/angular. We can
find there many repositories and each of them has its own contributors.

The goal was to create an app that will rank Angular repositories contributors and show them in
one list.

The app contains three distinct views:

  ● The list of contributors to all Angular repositories. 
    The ranking should be sortable by
    amount of contributions made by developer to all repositories, by amount of followers,
    public repos & gists he/she published.
    
  ● The details page of each contributor with all repositories he contributed to and his
    details.
    
  ● The repository details page where we can find other contributors.
